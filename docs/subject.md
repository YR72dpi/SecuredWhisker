# Integration Project  
M1 - “Lead FullStack Developer”

## Objective

Develop a web application in SaaS mode on a topic of your choice that meets a client need (and is therefore monetizable), with:

- A section accessible to authenticated users,
- A section accessible to authenticated administrators,
- A decoupled Front-end and Back-end Framework,
- A database.

The result does not require specific production but must meet all the constraints.

The technical stack is at your discretion.

Your project must be validated by the teaching team. Please submit it before 6:00 PM, Friday, October 25, 2024.

## Constraints

- The server must provide a Restful API to interact with the database and implement all CRUD functionalities.
- The project must be developed using a “Test Driven” (TDD) methodology.
- The project must implement a CI/CD approach.
- The project must use a cloud service or leverage an existing API (e.g., OAuth 2 authentication, etc.).
- The project must be structured in Micro-Services.

Final Deliverables

- A technical specification document for your project, including UML diagrams such as sequence diagrams and MCD.
- The project must be available on GitHub.
- The entire development process must be present with regular commits.
- The final result must be deployed with an SSL certificate.

Oral Presentation

- One mid-term presentation during the week of February 3, 2025
