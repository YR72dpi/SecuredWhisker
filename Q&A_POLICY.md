## ‚úÖ Example of a well-formulated question:

**Title**  
Error `tls: handshake failure` during build with Go 1.21 on Ubuntu 22.04

**Detailed description**  
Hello,  
I encounter an error when compiling the project on an Ubuntu 22.04 machine with Go 1.21. Here are the steps followed and the error message obtained:

**Steps to reproduce**
```bash
go version go1.21 linux/amd64
git clone https://github.com/YR72dpi/SecuredWhisker
cd SecuredWhisker
go build ./...
```

**Expected result**  
The build should complete without error.

**Actual result**  
The build fails with the following message:
```
tls: handshake failure
```

**Additional information**
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (up to date)
- Go version: 1.21
- Internet connection behind a proxy: No
- I tried disabling my firewall, without success.

**Attempts already made**
- Cleaned Go cache (`go clean -modcache`)
- Retried build after reboot

**Question**  
Has anyone encountered this issue? Is there a specific configuration required for Go 1.21
